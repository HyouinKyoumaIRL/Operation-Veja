# Operation-Veja
We are trying to use 1 million￥ to create the worlds' best roleplaying dataset

Veja is read as (vaega) as in operation Vega, referring to the final operation in the popular animated series Steins;gate

The current dataset contains three characters, Makise kurisu from steins;gate, Kafka from Honkai Starrail and Professor Lu, our original character.
The dataset contains timestamps and a multitude of multi-exchange conversations.
We mainly sourced our data in chinese because the laber is cheaper, and the audience has a larger passion.

We are also in our early stages, switching around our requirements as we learn new things about our data.
Our next steps are creating more online presense for the project, if you have any interest, please email our contact director @yuezel2@illinois.edu
