When you want to probe the brain, most people do break in with physical saws right, absolutely barbaric. But, if you have a high speed particle, say alpha particle, you can penetrate it with some data outputted. Now, it turns out, we have observed that by using cheap inhouse producable optical accelerators, you can generate entangled pairs of these shananigans into the brain, and read out the quantum signal on the other side. So now we can hit essentially all parts of a brain vs reconstructing surface signals that account for very little amount of the brain. ",
